# Shopify Single Checkout PoC

This is a proof of concept for a single checkout page for Shopify.
It is a single page checkout that uses the Shopify Buy SDK.

It is a work in progress and is not production ready.

The main idea is to prove that it's possible to create a Single Page checkout with AB testing based on the Shopify API.

- for GCC customer:
  - show a scroll or a accordion single checkout page.
- For other customers:
  - show a single checkout page with a multi step checkout.
